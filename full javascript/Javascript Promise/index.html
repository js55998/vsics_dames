<body>
    <p>A Promise is a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It allows handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. </p>
    <pre>
        A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
    </pre>
